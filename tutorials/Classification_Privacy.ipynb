        "[Differential privacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_privacy) (DP) is a framework that allows for measuring the privacy guarantees provided by a Machine Learning (ML) algorithm with respect to its input data. Recent advances allow the training of ML models with DP, greatly mitigating the risk of exposing sensitive training data in ML. Intuitively, a model trained with DP should not be affected by any single training example (or small set of training examples) in its dataset. \n",

        "The basic idea of this approach, called differentially private stochastic gradient descent (DP-SGD), is to modify the gradients\n",
        "used in stochastic gradient descent (SGD), which lies at the core of almost all deep learning algorithms. Models trained with DP-SGD provide provable differential privacy guarantees for their input data. There are two modifications made to the vanilla SGD algorithm:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. The sensitivity of each gradient is bounded by *clipping* the gradient computed for each training point. This limits how much each training point can possibly impact model parameters.\n",
        "2. *Random noise* is sampled and added to the clipped gradients to make it statistically impossible to know whether or not a particular data point was included in the training dataset by comparing the updates SGD applies when it operates with or without this particular data point in the training dataset.\n",

        "This tutorial uses [tf.keras](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/keras) to train a convolutional neural network (CNN) to recognize handwritten digits with the DP-SGD optimizer provided by the TensorFlow Privacy library. TensorFlow Privacy provides code that wraps an existing TensorFlow optimizer to create a variant that implements DP-SGD."
